	  <h2>About Us</h2>
	  <p>At <strong>UnitedWeRise.org</strong>, we believe that only by working together can we build a better tomorrow—for everyone. And when we say <em>everyone</em>, we don’t just mean all Americans. A more united America benefits people across the globe. We have an enormous capacity to do good. Artificially engineered division is what keeps us from realizing that potential.</p>
	  <p>In a healthy democracy, reasonable minds can disagree on issues like tax policy or social priorities. But without fair representation, those conversations become impossible. When our voices are ignored and our choices are manipulated, we’re left with unaccountable elites making decisions for us. Meanwhile, we’re forced into opposing corners, growing distrustful of one another.</p>
	  <p><strong>That’s why we launched UnitedWeRise.org.</strong></p>
	  <p>Our platform is built to resist the influence of big donors, lobbyists, and corporate media. You won’t be bombarded with ads, and no one can buy preferential status. We are committed to helping you stay informed—about how to run for office, who’s running, and what they actually stand for. You’ll hear directly from the candidates, not filtered through handlers or spin.</p>
	  <p>The Establishment wants to keep your choices limited to the ones they’ve approved so they can maintain the status quo. We believe it’s time to break those chains—and prosper together.</p>
	  <p><strong>Divided we fall.<br>United We Rise.</strong></p>

  <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
  <p>Research has shown that the policy preferences of average citizens have little to no impact on legislation outcomes<sup>1</sup>. Meanwhile, wealthy donors and interest groups wield disproportionate influence over our democratic institutions.</p>
