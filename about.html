        <h1>About United We Rise</h1>
	<p>Studies show that the wants and needs of average citizens have little to no impact on the success or failure of legislation(1). Our politicians are listening to wealthy donors, not us. If we want to vote them out, their donors buy up media ads to sway public sentiment, and divide us with culture wars. If they can get us to think that it's hopeless, or that it's just unreasonable to ask for change, they've won. At United We Rise, we refuse to let them divide us and we refuse to let them decide what we do and don't deserve. United We Rise was concieved of as a forum to inform people about the candidates who are seeking to represent them, and as a resource to demystify the process for those who might like to run for office, but don't know where to start. We hope to energize and empower people to run for office and have their name and ideas heard without being constrained by failed notions of parties.
