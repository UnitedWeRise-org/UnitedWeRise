# United We Rise - Security Deployment Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Going Live

### ‚úÖ Completed Security Implementations
- [x] **Security middleware**: helmet, CORS, rate limiting
- [x] **Input validation**: All endpoints protected with express-validator
- [x] **Password security**: bcrypt with configurable salt rounds (default: 12)
- [x] **JWT security**: Configurable expiration and secret
- [x] **Rate limiting**: Tiered limits for different endpoint types
- [x] **Environment configuration**: Proper .env structure

### üî¥ REQUIRED Before Production Deployment

#### 1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Generate a cryptographically secure JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Update your production .env file:
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-random-jwt-secret-from-openssl"
NODE_ENV="production"
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
FRONTEND_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"
```

#### 2. Database Security
- [ ] Use connection pooling and SSL for database connections
- [ ] Create dedicated database user with minimal permissions
- [ ] Enable database backups and point-in-time recovery
- [ ] Use environment variables for all database credentials

#### 3. HTTPS/SSL Certificate
- [ ] Obtain SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, or purchased)
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with SSL termination
- [ ] Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- [ ] Set HSTS headers for browser security

#### 4. Server Configuration
- [ ] Install production dependencies only: `npm ci --only=production`
- [ ] Use process manager (PM2, systemd) for automatic restarts
- [ ] Configure log rotation and monitoring
- [ ] Set up firewall rules (allow only necessary ports)

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Complete Within 1 Week

#### 5. Enhanced Security Headers
The current helmet configuration needs production tuning:
```javascript
// Update server.ts helmet config for production:
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "https://unpkg.com"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://unpkg.com"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss://yourdomain.com"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

#### 6. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, or similar)
- [ ] Configure structured logging (Winston, Pino)
- [ ] Monitor rate limit violations and suspicious activity
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot)

#### 7. Backup Strategy
- [ ] Automated database backups (daily minimum)
- [ ] Code repository backups
- [ ] Environment configuration backups (encrypted)
- [ ] Test restore procedures

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Complete Within 1 Month

#### 8. Advanced Authentication
- [ ] Implement email verification for new accounts
- [ ] Add password reset functionality with secure tokens
- [ ] Consider two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Session management and concurrent login limits

#### 9. API Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement API versioning (/api/v1/)
- [ ] Add request/response logging for security events
- [ ] Consider API key authentication for external integrations
- [ ] Implement soft account lockouts after failed login attempts

#### 10. Content Security
- [ ] Image upload validation and scanning
- [ ] Content moderation for posts and comments
- [ ] Spam detection and prevention
- [ ] User reporting system

## üîß Deployment Commands

### Development to Production Migration
```bash
# 1. Install production dependencies
cd backend
npm ci --only=production

# 2. Build the application
npm run build

# 3. Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Start with process manager
pm2 start dist/server.js --name "unitedwerise-api"
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Security Testing Commands
```bash
# Test rate limiting
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"wrong"}' \
  # Run this 6 times quickly to trigger rate limit

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: http://malicious-site.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With" \
  -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login
```

## üö® Security Incident Response Plan

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Change all JWT secrets
   - Revoke compromised tokens
   - Check server logs for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review rate limit logs
   - Check database for unauthorized changes
   - Analyze error logs for attack patterns

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify users if data was compromised
   - Document the incident for future prevention
   - Update security measures based on findings

## üìû Emergency Contacts

- Database Provider Support: [Your DB provider]
- SSL Certificate Provider: [Your SSL provider]
- Hosting Provider Support: [Your hosting provider]
- DNS Provider: [Your DNS provider]

## üîç Regular Security Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Review error logs for security events
- [ ] Check for failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor rate limit violations

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Security scan with tools like `npm audit`

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update incident response procedures
