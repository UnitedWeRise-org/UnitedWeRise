# SYSTEMATIC MIGRATION PROTOCOL
**Framework for Architectural Transformations**
*Based on the successful 100% inline code elimination project*

## 🎯 PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

This protocol captures the methodology that achieved **100% inline code elimination** from a 7,413-line monolithic file, transforming it into a professional ES6 modular architecture with zero functionality regression.

```

## 📊 TRACKING AND COORDINATION

### Progress Tracking System:
```
Use TodoWrite tool consistently:
1. Break work into specific, measurable tasks
2. Update status in real-time (in_progress/completed)
3. One task in_progress at a time
4. Mark completed immediately after finishing
5. Add new tasks as they're discovered

Example Task Structure:
{
  "content": "Phase 1A: Complete component inventory for [SYSTEM]",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "activeForm": "Inventorying [SYSTEM] components"
}
```

### Coordination Documents:
```
Create in .claude/scratchpads/:
- [PROJECT]-PROGRESS-LOG.md (real-time progress updates)
- [PROJECT]-MIGRATION-TRACKING.md (component/function tracking)
- [PROJECT]-RISK-ASSESSMENT.md (identified risks and mitigations)
- [PROJECT]-LESSONS-LEARNED.md (knowledge capture)
```

console.time('Page Load');
// Measure initial page load
console.timeEnd('Page Load');

// Module loading verification
console.log('Modules loaded:', Object.keys(window).filter(k => k.includes('Handler')));

// Event delegation verification
document.querySelectorAll('[data-action]').length; // Should show proper count
```
