## Security Audit Coordination

### Terminal 1 - Security Analysis Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Security Analysis Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Perform comprehensive security analysis of current codebase changes
2. Focus on authentication, authorization, and data validation patterns
3. Check for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
4. Document findings in .claude/scratchpads/SECURITY-AUDIT.md
5. Prioritize vulnerabilities by severity and impact

Security Focus Areas:
- Authentication: OAuth integration, JWT handling, session management
- Authorization: Admin privileges, role-based access, API endpoint protection
- Data Protection: Input validation, output encoding, sensitive data handling
- API Security: Rate limiting, CORS, error handling, response sanitization

United We Rise Specific Requirements:
- Admin-only debugging compliance (no console.log statements)
- Staging environment admin-only access verification
- Payment system PCI compliance patterns
- Civic platform data protection (voter information, candidate data)

Timeline: Complete initial analysis within 10-15 minutes
Escalation: Critical vulnerabilities require immediate attention"
```

### Terminal 2 - Vulnerability Testing Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Vulnerability Testing Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Monitor .claude/scratchpads/SECURITY-AUDIT.md for identified vulnerabilities
2. Test security findings on staging environment
3. Verify authentication and authorization controls
4. Document test results in .claude/scratchpads/VULNERABILITY-TESTS.md
5. Validate security fixes and improvements

Testing Procedures:
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization escalation testing
- Input validation boundary testing
- Session management verification
- API endpoint security testing

Staging Environment Testing:
- URL: https://dev.unitedwerise.org
- API: https://dev-api.unitedwerise.org
- Admin access verification required
- Test with both admin and non-admin accounts

Timeline: Complete testing within 10-15 minutes
Priority: Focus on high-severity vulnerabilities first"
```

### Terminal 3 - Compliance Verification Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Compliance Verification Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Verify compliance with United We Rise security standards
2. Check for proper admin-only debugging implementation
3. Validate staging environment access controls
4. Document compliance status in .claude/scratchpads/COMPLIANCE-STATUS.md
5. Ensure all security patterns follow established guidelines

Compliance Checklist:
- No console.log() statements in production code
- Admin-only debugging functions used correctly
- Staging environment requires admin authentication
- Sensitive data properly protected and encrypted
- Payment processing follows PCI compliance patterns

Platform-Specific Compliance:
- Civic data protection requirements
- Election system security standards
- Candidate information confidentiality
- User privacy protection measures

Timeline: Complete compliance check within 5-10 minutes
Approval: Required before any production deployment"
```
