# Smart Task Analysis & Auto-Sizing System

## Overview
Intelligent task analysis that automatically determines optimal approach (single vs multi-agent) with built-in safeguards and efficiency controls.

## Automatic Task Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Task Assessment
```bash
claude -p "SMART TASK ANALYSIS:

Before proceeding with any approach, analyze this task:

Task: [USER_TASK_DESCRIPTION]

Run automatic assessment:
1. **Complexity Scoring**: Use intelligent_multi_agent_analysis()
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Check against SINGLE_AGENT_PATTERNS and FORCE_MULTI_AGENT_PATTERNS
3. **Token Cost Estimation**: Calculate single vs multi-agent token usage
4. **Efficiency Prediction**: Estimate time savings vs coordination overhead
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify security, payment, or critical system involvement

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
üéØ **Task Analysis Complete**
- **Complexity Score**: [0-10]
- **Recommended Approach**: [single_agent|single_with_review|multi_agent_optional|multi_agent_recommended|multi_agent_required]
- **Reasoning**: [specific factors influencing recommendation]
- **Token Impact**: [minimal|low|medium|high] ([estimated tokens])
- **Time Estimate**: Single agent: [X] min | Multi-agent: [Y] min
- **Risk Factors**: [security_sensitive|payment_system|production_critical|etc.]

**Proceed with [recommended approach]? [Y/N/Alternative]**"
```

### Step 2: Smart Default Implementation
```javascript
// Automatic decision logic
const smartTaskRouting = {
  // AUTOMATIC SINGLE AGENT (No user decision required)
  autoSingleAgent: [
    "fix typo", "change color", "update comment", "remove unused import",
    "single line change", "css styling only", "quick fix"
  ],

  // AUTOMATIC MULTI-AGENT (Emergency scenarios)
  autoMultiAgent: [
    "production down", "users can't login", "payment failing",
    "security breach", "authentication broken"
  ],

  // USER CHOICE REQUIRED (Moderate complexity)
  userDecision: [
    "moderate complexity scores (4-6)",
    "cross-system changes", "new features",
    "performance optimization", "database changes"
  ]
};
```

## Built-in Efficiency Controls

### Token Budget Monitoring
```markdown
## Automatic Token Management

### Pre-Task Budget Check
- **Daily Budget**: Track remaining tokens for efficient usage
- **Task Cost Estimation**: Show upfront cost for both approaches
- **Budget Alert Thresholds**: Warning at 50%, 75%, 90% usage
- **Fallback Recommendation**: Suggest single agent when budget low

### Real-Time Token Tracking
```bash
# Automatic token monitoring during multi-agent workflows
echo "ü™ô Token Usage Monitor"
echo "Current Task Consumption: [X] tokens"
echo "Remaining Daily Budget: [Y] tokens"
echo "Projected Task Total: [Z] tokens"

if [ $Z -gt $Y ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Budget Exceeded - Recommend Single Agent Completion"
fi
```

### Task Complexity Reality Check
```python
def reality_check_task_complexity(initial_estimate, actual_progress):
    """
    Continuously assess if task is simpler than initially estimated
    """

    if actual_progress["lines_changed"] < 20 and initial_estimate >= 6:
        return {
            "recommendation": "fallback_to_single_agent",
            "reason": "Task simpler than expected - multi-agent overhead not justified",
            "action": "terminate_excess_agents"
        }

    if actual_progress["coordination_time"] > actual_progress["work_time"]:
        return {
            "recommendation": "reduce_coordination",
            "reason": "Coordination overhead exceeding productive work",
            "action": "streamline_communication"
        }

    return {"recommendation": "continue_current_approach"}
```

## Smart Intervention System

### Automatic Efficiency Monitoring
```bash
# Embedded in all multi-agent workflows
EFFICIENCY_MONITOR="
monitor_efficiency() {
  local start_time=\$(date +%s)
  local coordination_time=0
  local work_time=0

  # Track coordination vs work time ratio
  if [ \$coordination_time -gt \$((work_time * 2)) ]; then
    echo '‚ö†Ô∏è EFFICIENCY ALERT: Coordination overhead >200% of work time'
    echo 'Recommendation: Switch to single agent mode'
    echo 'Continue multi-agent? [Y/N]'
  fi
}
"
```

### Coordination Health Checks
```markdown
## Automatic Coordination Monitoring

### Deadlock Detection (Every 2 minutes)
- **No Progress Timer**: Alert if no updates for 5+ minutes
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Identify agents waiting for each other
- **Communication Breakdown**: Monitor for incompatible assumptions

### Auto-Recovery Protocols
- **Deadlock Recovery**: Automatic single-agent takeover after 8 minutes
- **Communication Failure**: Switch to direct instruction mode
- **Budget Exhaustion**: Immediate fallback to single agent
- **Time Pressure**: Emergency single-agent mode for urgent tasks
```

## Adaptive Learning System

### Success Pattern Recognition
```javascript
const adaptiveLearning = {
  // Track what works well
  successPatterns: {
    "user_profile_changes": "single_agent_preferred",
    "cross_system_features": "multi_agent_effective",
    "performance_optimization": "sequential_agents_optimal",
    "emergency_fixes": "parallel_agents_critical"
  },

  // Adjust thresholds based on experience
  dynamicThresholds: {
    multiAgentSuccessRate: 0.75, // Lower threshold if success rate drops
    coordinationEfficiency: 0.80, // Prefer single agent if coordination inefficient
    tokenEfficiencyTarget: 0.60   // Optimize for token usage vs time savings
  },

  // Learn user preferences
  userPatterns: {
    prefersMultiAgent: false, // Adjust based on user choices
    emergencyTolerance: "high", // Tolerance for coordination overhead in emergencies
    budgetSensitivity: "medium" // How much user cares about token costs
  }
};
```

### Feedback Integration
```markdown
## Continuous Improvement

### Post-Task Analysis
After each task completion:
1. **Efficiency Assessment**: Was the chosen approach optimal?
2. **Time Accuracy**: Did multi-agent actually save predicted time?
3. **Quality Impact**: Did parallel review catch more issues?
4. **User Satisfaction**: Did approach match user preferences?

### Threshold Adjustment
- **Lower complexity threshold** if multi-agent frequently fails
- **Raise efficiency requirements** if coordination often problematic
- **Adjust token sensitivity** based on budget constraints
- **Learn user preference patterns** for similar future tasks
```

## Emergency Override Controls

### Manual Override Commands
```bash
# Force single agent regardless of analysis
claude -p "FORCE SINGLE AGENT MODE: Complete this task with single agent only, ignore multi-agent suggestions"

# Force multi-agent for complex tasks
claude -p "FORCE MULTI-AGENT MODE: Use coordinated agents despite complexity score"

# Emergency simplification
claude -p "EMERGENCY SIMPLE MODE: Minimal coordination, basic task completion only"

# Budget-conscious mode
claude -p "BUDGET-CONSCIOUS MODE: Optimize for minimum token usage, prefer single agent"
```

### Fallback Triggers
```python
AUTOMATIC_FALLBACK_TRIGGERS = {
    "coordination_time_exceeded": 10,      # minutes
    "token_budget_threshold": 0.85,       # 85% of budget used
    "agent_error_count": 3,               # coordination errors
    "task_simpler_than_expected": True,   # reality check failed
    "user_frustration_detected": True,    # multiple manual interventions
    "emergency_time_pressure": True       # urgent production issues
}
```
