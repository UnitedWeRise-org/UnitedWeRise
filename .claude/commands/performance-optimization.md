# Performance Optimization Multi-Agent Workflow

## Overview
Systematic performance analysis and optimization using specialized agents for maximum efficiency and comprehensive coverage.

**Estimated Time Savings:** 35-45% compared to single-agent optimization

---

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Sequential Workflow (Recommended)
Optimizes feedback loops and ensures proper analysis before implementation.

### Parallel Workflow (Advanced)
For complex optimizations requiring simultaneous analysis and implementation.

---

## Sequential Optimization Workflow

### Phase 1: Performance Profiling Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Performance Profiling Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Identify performance bottlenecks across all system layers
2. Analyze My Feed infinite scroll performance specifically
3. Profile API response times and database query performance
4. Document baseline metrics in .claude/scratchpads/PERFORMANCE-METRICS.md
5. Prioritize optimization opportunities by impact

Analysis Focus:
- Frontend: Page load times, bundle sizes, rendering performance
- Backend: API response times, database queries, memory usage
- Database: Query performance, index usage, connection pooling
- My Feed: Infinite scroll, pagination, image loading

Tools and Methods:
- Browser DevTools performance analysis
- API endpoint response time measurement
- Database query analysis via logs
- Memory usage profiling
- Network performance assessment

Timeline: Complete analysis within 5-8 minutes
Deliverable: Prioritized list of optimization opportunities with impact estimates"
```

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizer Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Performance Optimizer Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Read performance analysis from .claude/scratchpads/PERFORMANCE-METRICS.md
2. Implement optimizations based on profiling data
3. Focus on highest-impact improvements first
4. Document all changes in .claude/scratchpads/OPTIMIZATION-LOG.md
5. Test optimizations on staging environment

Optimization Strategies:
- Database: Add indexes, optimize queries, improve pagination
- API: Implement caching, reduce response size, optimize serialization
- Frontend: Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
- My Feed: Virtualization, efficient pagination, caching strategies

Implementation Requirements:
- Work on development branch only
- Measure before/after performance
- Maintain functionality during optimization
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Test each optimization on staging

Timeline: Implement optimizations within 15-20 minutes
Priority: Focus on user-facing performance improvements"
```

### Phase 3: Performance Verification Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Performance Verification Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Monitor .claude/scratchpads/OPTIMIZATION-LOG.md for completed optimizations
2. Measure performance improvements using same methods as baseline
3. Verify no functionality regressions introduced
4. Document results in .claude/scratchpads/VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md
5. Approve optimizations for production deployment

Verification Process:
- Re-run baseline performance tests
- Compare before/after metrics
- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Verify My Feed infinite scroll performance
- Check mobile device performance

Acceptance Criteria:
- Performance improvements documented and verified
- No functionality regressions
- User experience maintained or improved
- Staging environment stable
- All tests passing

Timeline: Complete verification within 5-8 minutes
Approval: Only approve if improvements are measurable and no regressions"
```

## Parallel Optimization Workflow (Advanced)

### Terminal 1 - Continuous Profiling Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Continuous Profiling Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Continuously monitor performance metrics during optimization
2. Provide real-time feedback to optimizer agent
3. Update .claude/scratchpads/PERFORMANCE-METRICS.md with live data
4. Alert if performance degrades during optimization
5. Track optimization effectiveness in real-time

Monitoring Focus:
- Real-time API response times
- Database query performance
- Frontend rendering metrics
- Memory usage trends
- Error rate monitoring

Communication: Update metrics every 2-3 minutes during optimization"
```

### Terminal 2 - Performance Optimizer Agent
```bash
# Same as sequential workflow optimizer, but:
# - Monitor PERFORMANCE-METRICS.md for real-time feedback
# - Adjust optimization strategy based on live data
# - Implement iterative improvements
```

### Terminal 3 - Regression Testing Agent
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "You are the Regression Testing Agent for United We Rise. Your role:

1. Continuously test functionality during optimization
2. Monitor .claude/scratchpads/OPTIMIZATION-LOG.md for changes
3. Immediately test each optimization for regressions
4. Report issues to .claude/scratchpads/REGRESSION-ALERTS.md
5. Ensure user workflows remain functional

Testing Focus:
- User authentication and session management
- My Feed loading and infinite scroll
- Post creation and interaction
- Payment processing functionality
- Admin dashboard operations

Alert Triggers: Any functionality breaking or performance degrading"
```

## Optimization Strategies by Component

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Example optimizations to implement
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_posts_feed_query ON posts(created_at DESC, visibility);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_relationships ON user_relationships(follower_id, following_id);

-- Query optimization patterns
SELECT posts.* FROM posts
WHERE visibility = 'public'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 15 OFFSET ?;
```

### API Optimizations
```javascript
// Caching strategy
const cacheKey = `feed:${userId}:${offset}`;
const cachedFeed = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cachedFeed) return JSON.parse(cachedFeed);

// Response optimization
const optimizedResponse = {
  posts: posts.map(post => ({
    id: post.id,
    content: post.content.substring(0, 280), // Truncate for feed
    author: { id: post.author.id, name: post.author.name },
    // Only essential fields for feed display
  }))
};
```

### Frontend Optimizations
```javascript
// Infinite scroll optimization
const InfiniteScrollOptimized = () => {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  // Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
  // Lazy load images with intersection observer
  // Debounce scroll events
};
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Real-Time Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Performance monitoring setup
const performanceMonitor = {
  trackAPIResponse: (endpoint, duration) => {
    if (duration > thresholds[endpoint]) {
      alert(`Performance degradation: ${endpoint} took ${duration}ms`);
    }
  },

  trackUserExperience: (metric, value) => {
    // Track Core Web Vitals
    // Monitor user interaction delays
    // Alert on performance regressions
  }
