## Manual Testing Required

The following tests require browser access and cannot be automated via CLI. These tests must be performed manually before production deployment.

### Priority Test 1: Basic Photo Upload (Test #1 from checklist)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to https://dev.unitedwerise.org
2. Log in as admin user
3. Open post creator
4. Select a 2MB JPEG file
5. Click upload
6. Observe network traffic in DevTools

**Expected Results:**
- Upload completes within 10 seconds
- POST request to `/api/photos/upload` with `multipart/form-data`
- Response: 201 Created
- Response body contains: `{ success: true, photo: { id, url, thumbnailUrl, width, height } }`
- Photo appears in feed
- Photo URL is Azure Blob Storage URL
- Image loads in browser

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

### Priority Test 2: Multiple File Upload (Test #2 from checklist)

**Steps:**
1. Upload 3 photos in one post
2. Verify all 3 upload successfully
3. Verify all 3 appear in feed

**Expected Results:**
- All 3 photos upload sequentially
- Each gets unique ID
- Each gets unique blob name
- All 3 appear in feed
- Total upload time < 30 seconds

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

### Priority Test 3: EXIF Metadata Stripping (Test #11 from checklist)

**Steps:**
1. Upload a photo with GPS EXIF metadata
2. Note the photo URL from response
3. Download the photo from Azure Blob Storage
4. Run: `exiftool downloaded-photo.webp`

**Expected Results:**
- Upload succeeds (201 Created)
- Downloaded file has NO GPS coordinates
- Downloaded file has NO camera serial number
- Downloaded file has NO timestamp metadata

**Verification Command:**
```bash
exiftool downloaded-photo.webp | grep GPS
# Expected output: (no results)

exiftool downloaded-photo.webp | grep -i "camera"
# Expected output: (no results)
```

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

### Priority Test 4: File Type Validation (Test #6 from checklist)

**Steps:**
1. Attempt to upload a .txt file renamed to .jpg

**Expected Results:**
- Upload rejected
- Status: 400 Bad Request
- Response: `{ error: "Invalid image file", message: "File is not a valid image (magic bytes check failed)" }`
- No blob created in Azure

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

### Priority Test 5: File Size Validation (Test #7 from checklist)

**Steps:**
1. Attempt to upload a 15MB JPEG file

**Expected Results:**
- Upload rejected by multer BEFORE processing
- Status: 413 Payload Too Large
- Response: `{ error: "File too large", message: "Photos must be smaller than 10MB" }`
- No blob created in Azure

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

## Performance Benchmarks

**Cannot be tested via CLI** - Requires browser DevTools Network tab

**Target Metrics:**
- 1MB upload: < 6 seconds
- 5MB upload: < 12 seconds
- 10MB upload: < 18 seconds

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

## Azure Blob Storage Verification

**Cannot be accessed via CLI** - Requires Azure Portal or authenticated az storage commands

**Manual Verification Required:**
1. Navigate to Azure Portal → Storage Account uwrstorage2425
2. Open Container: `photos` → `posts`
3. Check for newly uploaded blobs
4. Verify blobs are recent (check Last Modified timestamp)
5. Download a blob and verify:
   - File is WebP format (or GIF if original was GIF)
   - File has no EXIF metadata (run `exiftool`)
   - File is properly sanitized

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

## Database Verification

**Cannot be accessed via CLI** - Requires database connection

**Manual Verification Required:**
```sql
-- Count photos created during testing
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Photo"
WHERE "createdAt" > '2025-10-02T17:00:00Z'
AND "userId" = [test-user-id];

-- Check for photos without blob URLs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Photo"
WHERE "url" IS NULL OR "thumbnailUrl" IS NULL;

-- Verify storage usage calculation
SELECT "userId", SUM("compressedSize") as total_usage
FROM "Photo"
WHERE "userId" = [test-user-id]
GROUP BY "userId";
```

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TEST

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Perform Manual Browser Testing**
   - Open https://dev.unitedwerise.org in browser
   - Execute Priority Tests 1-5 (listed above)
   - Document results

2. **EXIF Stripping Verification**
   - Upload photo with GPS metadata
   - Download from Azure Blob Storage
   - Run exiftool to confirm stripping

3. **Azure Blob Storage Audit**
   - Verify blobs are sanitized
   - Verify no orphaned blobs exist
   - Verify blob naming convention matches new format

4. **Database Audit**
   - Verify Photo records created correctly
   - Verify storage usage calculation
   - Verify no records with NULL URLs

### Before Production Deployment

**DO NOT PROCEED TO PRODUCTION UNTIL:**
1. All 5 priority tests pass in staging
2. EXIF stripping verified with exiftool
3. Azure Blob Storage verified manually
4. At least 10 successful test uploads completed
5. No errors observed in backend logs after testing

### Production Deployment Checklist

When manual testing is complete and all tests pass:

1. Verify on development branch (if changes were on development)
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   ```

2. Merge to main (if needed)
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge development
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Deploy backend to production
   ```bash
   GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
   DOCKER_TAG="backend-prod-$GIT_SHA-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

   az acr build --registry uwracr2425 \
     --image "unitedwerise-backend:$DOCKER_TAG" \
     --no-wait \
     https://github.com/UnitedWeRise-org/UnitedWeRise.git#main:backend

   # Wait 3 minutes, then:
   DIGEST=$(az acr repository show --name uwracr2425 \
     --image "unitedwerise-backend:$DOCKER_TAG" \
     --query "digest" -o tsv)

   az containerapp update \
     --name unitedwerise-backend \
     --resource-group unitedwerise-rg \
     --image "uwracr2425.azurecr.io/unitedwerise-backend@$DIGEST" \
     --revision-suffix "prod-$GIT_SHA-$(date +%H%M%S)" \
     --set-env-vars \
       NODE_ENV=production \
       RELEASE_SHA=$GIT_SHA \
       RELEASE_DIGEST=$DIGEST
   ```

4. Verify production deployment
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api.unitedwerise.org/health" | grep releaseSha
   ```

5. Monitor production logs for 1 hour
   ```bash
   az containerapp logs show \
     --name unitedwerise-backend \
     --resource-group unitedwerise-rg \
     --tail 100 --follow
   ```

6. Test first production upload
   - Upload test photo on www.unitedwerise.org
   - Verify success
   - Monitor logs for errors
