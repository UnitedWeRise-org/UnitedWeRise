## Backend Integration Status

### Expected Endpoints (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

The implementation is designed to work with these backend endpoints when they become available:

#### Petitions:
- `POST /api/petitions/create` - Create new petition
- `GET /api/petitions` - List all petitions
- `GET /api/petitions/user/:userId` - Get user's petitions
- `POST /api/petitions/:id/sign` - Sign a petition (future)

#### Events:
- `POST /api/events/create` - Create new event
- `GET /api/events` - List all events
- `GET /api/events/user/:userId` - Get user's events
- `POST /api/events/:id/rsvp` - RSVP to event (future)

### Fallback Strategy

When endpoints return 404:
1. Show user-friendly "coming soon" message
2. Save to localStorage as fallback
3. Still navigate to success view (My Organizing)
4. User experience remains smooth

### Data Persistence

**localStorage Keys**:
- `petitionDraft` - Single petition draft
- `eventDraft` - Single event draft
- `localPetitions` - Array of created petitions
- `localEvents` - Array of created events

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
// Petition
{
  id: timestamp,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  target: string,
  goal: number,
  signatures: number,
  createdBy: userId,
  createdAt: ISO timestamp
}

// Event
{
  id: timestamp,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  dateTime: ISO timestamp,
  location: string,
  category: string,
  rsvps: number,
  createdBy: userId,
  createdAt: ISO timestamp
}
```

---

## Navigation Integration

### Navigation Handler Updates

All civic actions are integrated into the navigation system via `navigation-handlers.js`:

```javascript
case 'close-civic-organizing':
    if (typeof window.closeCivicOrganizing === 'function') {
        window.closeCivicOrganizing();
    }
    break;

case 'create-petition':
    if (typeof window.showPetitionCreator === 'function') {
        window.showPetitionCreator();
    }
    break;

case 'organize-event':
    if (typeof window.showEventCreator === 'function') {
        window.showEventCreator();
    }
    break;

case 'find-events':
    if (typeof window.showCivicBrowser === 'function') {
        window.showCivicBrowser();
    }
    break;

case 'my-activities':
    if (typeof window.showMyOrganizing === 'function') {
        window.showMyOrganizing();
    }
    break;
```

### HTML Integration

All buttons in `index.html` use `data-action` attributes:

```html
<button data-action="create-petition">📝 Create Petition</button>
<button data-action="organize-event">📅 Organize Event</button>
<button data-action="find-events">🔍 Find Events</button>
<button data-action="my-activities">📊 My Activities</button>
<button data-action="close-civic-organizing">×</button>
```

## Technical Architecture

### Module Structure

```
civic-organizing.js
├── Imports
│   ├── apiClient (from core/api/client.js)
│   └── showToast (from utils/toast.js)

│   ├── savePetitionToLocalStorage()
│   ├── saveEventToLocalStorage()
│   ├── displayCivicBrowser()
│   └── displayMyOrganizing()
└── Global Exposure
    └── All public functions exposed on window for compatibility
```

### ES6 Module Exports

```javascript
export {
    showPetitionCreator,
    showEventCreator,
    showCivicBrowser,
    showMyOrganizing,
    closeCivicOrganizing,
    showDefaultOrganizingView,
    savePetitionDraft,
    saveEventDraft
};
```

### Global Compatibility

All functions are exposed on `window` object for backward compatibility:

```javascript
window.showPetitionCreator = showPetitionCreator;
window.showEventCreator = showEventCreator;
window.showCivicBrowser = showCivicBrowser;
window.showMyOrganizing = showMyOrganizing;
window.closeCivicOrganizing = closeCivicOrganizing;
window.showDefaultOrganizingView = showDefaultOrganizingView;
window.savePetitionDraft = savePetitionDraft;
window.saveEventDraft = saveEventDraft;
```

---

## Error Handling

### Authentication Checks

All functions requiring authentication check `window.currentUser`:

```javascript
if (!window.currentUser) {
    showToast('Please log in to create a petition');
    return;
}
```

### API Error Handling

```javascript
try {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/api/petitions/create', data);
    if (response.ok) {
        showToast('Petition created successfully!');
        showMyOrganizing();
    }
} catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('404')) {
        // Endpoint doesn't exist - use fallback
        savePetitionToLocalStorage(data);
        showToast('Petition feature coming soon! Saved locally.');
        showMyOrganizing();
    } else {
        // Other error
        showToast('Failed to create petition. Please try again.');
    }
}
```

### Form Validation

```javascript
if (!title || !description || !goal) {
    showToast('Please fill in all required fields');
    return;
}
```

### Loading States

```javascript
submitBtn.textContent = 'Creating...';
submitBtn.disabled = true;

// ... operation ...

submitBtn.textContent = 'Publish Petition';
submitBtn.disabled = false;
```
