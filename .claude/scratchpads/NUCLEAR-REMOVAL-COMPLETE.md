### Simple URL Fields (Strings)

✅ **Database synced** - `db push` completed successfully
✅ **Client generated** - Prisma Client regenerated

### Git Status
✅ **Committed** - All changes committed to main
✅ **Pushed** - Changes pushed to GitHub
✅ **Tagged** - Rollback point created

## Rollback Procedure

If needed, revert with:

```bash
# Code rollback
git reset --hard nuclear-removal-point
git push origin main --force

# Database rollback (if backup was created)
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup-before-photo-removal-YYYYMMDD.sql
```

## Next Phase: Layer 0 Minimal Upload

**Status:** Ready to begin

**Objective:** Build absolute minimal photo upload (60 lines) to test basic transport:
- Multer memory storage
- Azure Blob upload
- Structured logging
- NO auth, NO validation, NO processing (pure file transport test)

**Success Criteria:**
- File reaches Azure Storage
- Logs trace entire request flow
- Proves Azure Container Apps allows multipart uploads

**Ready to proceed?** Phase 2 implementation documented in:
- `.claude/scratchpads/PHOTO-UPLOAD-MINIMAL-DESIGN.md`
- `.claude/scratchpads/PHOTO-UPLOAD-PIPELINE-DESIGN.md`

---

## Summary

**Phase 0-1 Complete:** Nuclear removal executed successfully
- Clean slate achieved
- Zero photo upload code remains
- All broken references fixed
- TypeScript compiles cleanly
- Database schema updated
- Ready for clean rebuild

**Total Time:** ~2 hours (assessment + removal + fixes)
**Next Phase:** Layer 0 minimal upload (est. 30 min)
