---

## Cross-Controller Tests

### Event Isolation (Critical)
- [ ] Open user profile modal
- [ ] While modal is open, click "Badge Management" tab
- [ ] Badge tab should NOT switch (user modal is in #users section)
- [ ] Close user modal
- [ ] Now click "Badge Management" tab
- [ ] Badge tab SHOULD switch (no modal blocking)

### No Console Warnings
- [ ] **No "Unknown users action" warnings**
- [ ] **No "Unknown civic-engagement action" warnings**
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] No event delegation errors

### Multiple Section Navigation
- [ ] Navigate to Users section
- [ ] Perform user action (e.g., view profile)
- [ ] Navigate to Civic Engagement section
- [ ] Perform civic action (e.g., switch tab)
- [ ] Navigate back to Users section
- [ ] User section still works
- [ ] Navigate back to Civic Engagement
- [ ] Civic section still works

---

## Regression Tests (Other Sections)

### Content Moderation

- [ ] Block IP addresses
- [ ] Security actions work

### Reports Management

- [ ] Review reports
- [ ] Report actions work

### Other Sections
- [ ] Overview section loads
- [ ] Analytics section loads
- [ ] MOTD section works
- [ ] Deployment section works

---

## Performance Tests

### Event Handler Count
- [ ] Open browser DevTools → Performance → Event Listeners
- [ ] Check document-level listeners
- [ ] Should see FEWER document-level listeners than before
- [ ] UsersController listeners only on #users
- [ ] CivicEngagementController listeners only on #civic-engagement

### Memory Leaks
- [ ] Navigate between sections multiple times
- [ ] Open/close modals multiple times
- [ ] Check DevTools → Memory
- [ ] No significant memory growth

---

## Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if available)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Badge Management tab switching works** (primary issue)
✅ **User activity checkboxes work** (no regression)
✅ **Zero "Unknown action" console warnings**
✅ **Zero stopImmediatePropagation calls in code**
✅ **All modals open/close correctly**
✅ **No cross-controller interference**
✅ **All admin features still functional**

---

## Known Issues / Edge Cases

**Modals appended to body:**
- User modals may be appended to document.body (outside #users)
- This is OK - modal close handlers are on click events that bubble
- Scoped delegation still applies to buttons INSIDE the modal

**Lazy-loaded controllers:**
- CivicEngagementController is lazy-loaded (on tab click)
- Test that init() works correctly when section already exists
- Test that event listeners don't duplicate

---

## If Test Fails

### Badge tab doesn't switch
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `this.section` is not null in CivicEngagementController
3. Verify section ID is 'civic-engagement' in HTML
4. Check DevTools → Elements → #civic-engagement exists
5. Verify event listener attached (DevTools → Event Listeners)

### User checkboxes don't work
1. Verify no stopImmediatePropagation in code
2. Check that event listener is on #users section
3. Verify checkbox click events bubble to section
4. Check DevTools → Event Listeners on checkbox

### Console warnings appear
1. Identify which controller is logging the warning
2. Check if action is in wrong controller's handler
3. Verify scoped delegation is working (events not leaking)
