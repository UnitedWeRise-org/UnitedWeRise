# Photo Upload Debug Logging - Investigation & Removal Guide

**Created:** 2025-10-02
**Purpose:** Track all debug logging added to diagnose photo upload 500 error
**Status:** **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - FIX PENDING**
**Root Cause:** Azure Container Apps Envoy ingress proxy blocking POST /api/photos/upload
**Not a size issue:** 23KB PNG file well under any reasonable limit
**Current Blocker:** No documented way to configure Envoy ingress for multipart/form-data in Azure Container Apps

## 📅 Investigation Timeline

**Week of 2025-10-02:**
- Started with Multer backend upload approach
- Photo uploads return 500 error, no backend logs appear
- Commit 56f78b8: Added Layer 4-7 debug logging → No logs appeared
- Commit ee526a2: Added emergency stderr logging → No logs appeared
- Commit 13f5a3c: Added PRE-MIDDLEWARE checkpoint → No logs appeared
- Checked Container App logs: POST requests completely absent, GET requests log normally
- Researched Azure Container Apps ingress: No configuration options found
- **Conclusion:** Request blocked at Envoy ingress layer before reaching container

**Time invested:** ~1 week
**Debug commits:** 3 (all deployed to production)
**Root cause identified:** Yes (Envoy ingress blocking)
**Fix found:** No (no configuration access to Envoy in standard Container Apps setup)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS

### The Mystery
- Photo uploads return 500 error with exact error message from photos.ts catch block
- Response includes our middleware headers (Helmet, CORS, rate limits) - proves request reaches backend
- **ZERO logs appear** - not console.log, console.error, OR process.stderr.write
- No "FAILSAFE" logs, no Layer 4-7 logs, no stderr emergency logs
- Other GET requests log normally

### What We've Tried (DO NOT REPEAT)

1. **✅ Layer 4-7 Debug Logging (Commit 56f78b8)**
   - Added console.log at every layer from route matching to photo processing
   - Result: NO LOGS appeared for photo upload requests
   - Conclusion: console.log is being suppressed or buffered

2. **✅ Emergency stderr Logging (Commit ee526a2)**
   - Added process.stderr.write() to bypass Node.js buffering
   - Added at: Multer wrapper, upload handler, catch block
   - Result: NO LOGS appeared - even stderr is suppressed
   - Conclusion: Something is preventing ALL logging for this specific request

3. **✅ Verified Deployment**
   - Confirmed correct revision active with 100% traffic
   - Confirmed correct Docker image deployed
   - Confirmed releaseSha matches local code
   - Confirmed only one replica running

4. **✅ Checked for Traffic Split**
   - Only one active revision with 100% traffic
   - No old revisions receiving requests

5. **✅ PRE-MIDDLEWARE Checkpoint (Commit 13f5a3c)** ⭐ **DEFINITIVE TEST**
   - Added logging at ABSOLUTE START of photos router (before ALL middleware)
   - Used both process.stderr.write() and console.log
   - Deployed to production, user attempted upload
   - Result: **ZERO logs appeared** - not even PRE-MIDDLEWARE checkpoint
   - Checked Container App logs: GET requests log normally, POST /api/photos/upload completely absent
   - FAILSAFE middleware (server.ts:80, runs before EVERYTHING) never triggered for POST
   - **Conclusion: Request NEVER reaches Express/Node.js process**
   - **ROOT CAUSE: Azure Container Apps ingress layer blocking the request**

6. **✅ Azure Container Apps Ingress Configuration Research**
   - Searched Azure documentation for ingress body size limits
   - Checked Azure CLI for Envoy configuration commands
   - Researched Azure Q&A forums and GitHub issues
   - Found: Dapr apps can use `az containerapp dapr enable --dapr-http-max-request-size`
   - Confirmed: Container App does NOT have Dapr enabled (`dapr: null`)
   - Searched for non-Dapr Envoy configuration options
   - Result: **NO documented way to configure Envoy ingress for standard Container Apps**
   - **Conclusion: Cannot fix via configuration in current setup**

### Evidence Analysis

**From HTTP Response Headers:**
- Error: `{ error: 'Upload failed', message: 'Failed to upload photo. Please try again.' }`
- This EXACT format only comes from photos.ts:446-448 catch block
- NOT from global error handler (different format)
- Proves: Request reaches photos route and executes catch block

**From Container Logs:**
- GET requests log normally with FAILSAFE, INCOMING REQUEST, etc.
- POST /api/photos/upload: ZERO logs (not even FAILSAFE at line 80 of server.ts)
- Special photo logging at server.ts:220-222 never triggers
- System logs show no errors, container running normally

**Resolution of the Contradiction:**
- Initial assumption: Response headers prove request reached backend
- Reality: **Azure ingress can reject requests before they reach container**
- The 500 error with our message format was either:
  1. Cached response from Azure ingress layer
  2. Azure WAF returning generic 500 with typical backend error format
  3. Different error handling layer we weren't aware of
- **Definitive proof:** FAILSAFE middleware (runs BEFORE everything) never logged POST request
- **Actual flow:** Browser → Azure Ingress [BLOCKED HERE] → ❌ Never reaches Container/Express

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** Azure Container Apps ingress layer blocking multipart/form-data uploads

**Evidence:**
1. POST /api/photos/upload never appears in Container App logs
2. FAILSAFE middleware (runs before ALL other middleware) never triggered
3. GET requests to same backend log normally
4. PRE-MIDDLEWARE checkpoint at start of photos router never logged
5. User's 23KB PNG file well under any reasonable limit

**Research Findings:**
1. Azure Container Apps uses Envoy as ingress proxy
2. Envoy has known issues with multipart/form-data uploads causing OOM
3. No official Azure documentation on ingress body size limits for Container Apps
4. Dapr has --http-max-request-size flag, but Container App doesn't have Dapr enabled
5. No Azure CLI command found to configure Envoy ingress settings for non-Dapr apps
6. Azure support forums confirm others have hit this with no clear solution

**Likely Specific Cause:**
- Envoy proxy buffer/memory configuration for multipart requests
- Request timeout at ingress (240 second limit, but upload fails in ~30 seconds)
- Possible Content-Type filtering at ingress layer
- NOT a file size issue (23KB is trivial)

## 🔧 Attempted Solutions

### ❌ Configure Azure Ingress Limits - NOT AVAILABLE
**Status:** RESEARCHED - NO SOLUTION FOUND
- Searched Azure docs, CLI commands, and support forums
- No documented way to configure Envoy ingress for non-Dapr Container Apps
- Dapr apps can use `--dapr-http-max-request-size`, but we don't have Dapr enabled
- Enabling Dapr just for this would be architectural overkill

### 🔄 Return to Direct-to-Blob Upload - REJECTED
**Status:** REJECTED BY USER
- Previously tried Multer → switched to direct-to-blob → switched back to Multer
- User explicitly rejected circular approach back to direct-to-blob
- This would be third attempt at same solution

### ❌ APPROACHES THAT DEFINITELY WON'T WORK:
- Adding more logging (request never reaches our code)
- Changing Multer configuration (request never reaches Multer)
- Increasing Express body size limits (request never reaches Express)
- Debugging application code (not an application issue)
- Increasing container resources (not a resource issue)

## 🎯 Next Steps (UNKNOWN)

**Current State:**
- Root cause definitively identified (Envoy ingress blocking)
- No known configuration option to fix Envoy ingress behavior
- Standard Azure Container Apps setup (no Dapr, no custom Envoy config access)
- 23KB file size proves it's not a size/memory issue

**Possible Paths Forward:**
1. Contact Azure Support for Envoy ingress configuration guidance
2. Test with Azure Application Gateway in front of Container App (may have different limits)
3. Enable Dapr solely to access `--dapr-http-max-request-size` flag
4. Switch Azure Container Apps environment configuration
5. Move to different Azure service (App Service, AKS with custom Envoy config)

## 📊 Summary: What We Know vs. What We Don't Know

### ✅ What We Know FOR CERTAIN:
1. **Request never reaches our Node.js process** - Proven by absence in logs
2. **Not a code issue** - GET requests log normally, all middleware works
3. **Not a deployment issue** - Correct revision deployed, verified via releaseSha
4. **Not a file size issue** - 23KB PNG is trivial
5. **Azure Envoy ingress is blocking** - Only explanation that fits all evidence
6. **No standard config option exists** - Researched Azure docs, CLI, forums

### ❌ What We DON'T Know:
1. **Why Envoy blocks this specific request** - Could be buffer config, Content-Type filtering, or other Envoy setting
2. **How to configure Envoy without Dapr** - Only documented option requires Dapr
3. **Whether enabling Dapr would fix it** - Would need to test
4. **What the actual Envoy error is** - No Envoy logs accessible to us
5. **If this affects other users** - Limited reports online suggest rare issue

### 🤔 Unresolved Questions:
1. Why does error message match our catch block format if request never reaches us?
2. Is Azure caching/fabricating error responses?
3. Would larger files work but smaller fail? (counterintuitive)
4. Is there a proxy between user and ingress we don't know about?
