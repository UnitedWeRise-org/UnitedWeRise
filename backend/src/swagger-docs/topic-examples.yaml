            description: "Discussion about healthcare policy changes and universal healthcare implementation"
            category: "healthcare"
            argumentsFor:
              - "Universal healthcare would reduce administrative costs and provide coverage for all citizens"
              - "Evidence from other countries shows successful implementation of single-payer systems"
              - "Healthcare costs would be more predictable and controlled under government oversight"
            argumentsAgainst:
              - "Implementation costs are too high and would require significant tax increases"
              - "Market-based solutions provide more choice and innovation than government systems"
              - "Wait times for non-emergency procedures could increase under government-run healthcare"
            neutralSummary: "The debate centers on cost vs access, with supporters emphasizing universal coverage benefits and critics focusing on implementation challenges and fiscal concerns."
