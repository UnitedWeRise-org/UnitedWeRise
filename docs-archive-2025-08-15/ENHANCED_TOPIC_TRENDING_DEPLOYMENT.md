- **`POST /api/topic-navigation/enter/{topicId}`**: Enter topic filtering mode
- **`POST /api/topic-navigation/exit`**: Return to algorithm feed
- **`GET /api/topic-navigation/{topicId}/posts`**: Paginated topic posts
- **`GET /api/topic-navigation/current`**: Check current navigation state

#### **Fallback System**
1. **AI Topics**: Azure OpenAI powered topic discovery
2. **Post Fallback**: Traditional trending posts if AI unavailable
3. **Static Fallback**: Hardcoded topics if both systems fail
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with user-friendly fallbacks

### Performance Optimizations

#### **Caching Strategy**
- **Topic Cache**: 2-minute cache for AI topics to prevent excessive API calls

- **State Management**: Cached My Feed state for smooth topic mode transitions

#### **Cross-System Compatibility**
- **MapLibre Support**: Full compatibility with modern MapLibre GL maps
- **Leaflet Support**: Maintained compatibility with legacy Leaflet maps
- **Mobile Responsive**: All features work across desktop, tablet, and mobile

## üîÑ User Experience Flow

### **Discovery Phase**
1. User sees AI-synthesized topics in trending panels (mini and sidebar)
2. Same topics appear as speech bubbles on the map
3. Topics show rich context: titles, summaries, engagement metrics
4. Geographic labels indicate topic relevance (National, [State Local], [Regional])

### **Engagement Phase**
1. User clicks any topic (panel or map bubble)
2. System enters "Topic Mode" with loading indicator
3. My Feed gets replaced with topic-filtered content
4. Rich topic header shows prevailing position and leading critique

### **Navigation Phase**
1. User explores topic-related posts in filtered feed
2. Easy "Exit Topic" button returns to algorithm feed
3. Cached state restoration provides seamless transitions
4. Geographic timing ensures balanced topic diversity

### **Geographic Intelligence**
1. **National View**: Shows primarily national topics
2. **Periodic Local**: Every 45-60 seconds, local topics appear for balance
3. **State/Local Views**: Adapted topic distribution based on zoom level
4. **User Context**: Topics relevant to user's geographic location
