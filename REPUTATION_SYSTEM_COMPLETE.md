# UnitedWeRise Reputation System - Complete Implementation

## üèÜ Overview

A comprehensive 0-100 reputation scoring system that promotes civil discourse without censorship. Users start at 70 and earn/lose points based on behavior, not political opinions.

**Core Philosophy**: "Transparent Accountability, Not Censorship"
- Everyone can speak freely
- Reputation affects visibility, never blocks speech
- Focus on behavior/civility, not content/opinions
- Mild algorithmic adjustments (¬±10-20% visibility)

---

## üìä System Architecture

### Score Mechanics
- **Range**: 0-100 (no negative values)
- **Starting Score**: 70 (new users)
- **No Automatic Decay**: Scores only change through actions
- **Per-Post Penalty Cap**: Prevents pile-on attacks

### Algorithmic Effects
```
Score 95+:  +10% visibility boost (1.1x multiplier)
Score 50-94: Normal visibility (1.0x multiplier)
Score 30-49: -10% suppression (0.9x multiplier) 
Score <30:   -20% suppression (0.8x multiplier)
```

### Penalty Structure (Per Post)
```
Hate Speech:           -10 points
Harassment:            -8 points
Spam/Duplicates:       -2 points
Excessive Profanity:   -3 points (AI context-aware)
Personal Attacks:      -1 point
```

### Reward Structure (Daily Max: +2)
```
Quality Posts (5+ likes): +0.5 points
Constructive Dialogue:    +0.25 points
Helpful Content:          +0.25 points
Positive Feedback:        +0.25 points
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Services

#### 1. ReputationService (`backend/src/services/reputationService.ts`)
**Main Functions:**
- `getUserReputation(userId)` - Get current score and tier
- `generateContentWarning(content, userId)` - Pre-post analysis
- `analyzeAndApplyPenalties(content, userId, postId)` - Auto-moderation
- `awardReputation(userId, reason, postId)` - Positive reinforcement
- `processReport(reporterId, targetUserId, postId, reason)` - Community reports
- `processAppeal(userId, eventId, reason)` - Appeal system

**Key Features:**
- Azure OpenAI integration for sophisticated content analysis
- Per-post penalty caps (no pile-ons)
- Daily reward limits (+2 max per day)
- AI-powered appeals with admin escalation

#### 2. Updated Feed Algorithm (`backend/src/services/probabilityFeedService.ts`)
**Reputation Integration:**
- Added `reputation` weight factor (10% of feed algorithm)
- Visibility multipliers applied to final scores
- Higher reputation = better visibility in feeds
- Lower reputation = reduced (not eliminated) visibility

#### 3. Content Warning Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/reputationWarning.ts`)
**Middleware Functions:**
- `analyzeContentForWarning` - Non-blocking content analysis
- `requireWarningAcknowledgment` - Strict pre-post warnings
- `applyReputationPenalties` - Post-creation penalty application
- `warningRateLimit` - Prevents warning spam (max 5/hour)

### Database Schema

#### Updated User Model
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  reputationScore     Int?      @default(70)
  reputationUpdatedAt DateTime?
  reputationEvents    ReputationEvent[]
}
```

#### New ReputationEvent Model
```prisma
model ReputationEvent {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  type         String   // 'penalty' or 'reward'
  reason       String   // 'hate_speech', 'quality_post', etc.
  points       Float    // Points added/removed
  
  postId       String?  // Related post if applicable
  post         Post?    @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  
  validated    Boolean  @default(false) // AI/human validated?
  scoreBefore  Int      // Transparency logging
  scoreAfter   Int      // Transparency logging
  
  metadata     Json?    // Additional context
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
}
```

#### Updated Post Model
```prisma
model Post {
  // ... existing fields ...

## üéØ Content Analysis System

### AI-Powered Detection
Uses Azure OpenAI (`gpt-35-turbo`) for sophisticated content analysis:

1. **Context-Aware**: Distinguishes between offensive and expressive language
2. **Political-Neutral**: Focuses on behavior, not opinions
3. **Conservative Flagging**: Only flags clear violations
4. **Fallback Graceful**: Continues without AI if service unavailable

### Content Warning Flow
```
User writes post ‚Üí AI analyzes ‚Üí Warning shown (if needed) ‚Üí 
User can Edit (gain points) or Post Anyway (lose points) ‚Üí 
Content posted ‚Üí Community can report ‚Üí Score adjusts
```

### Example Warning Message
```
We don't aim to prevent anyone from sharing their ideas, 
but please keep things civil.

Your post contains: personal attack

To maintain a positive community environment, we kindly ask 
you to reconsider how you might convey your ideas in a more 
constructive manner.

You may still post, but this content will be flagged and may 
affect your Community Reputation Score (potential impact: -1 points).

‚òê I understand this notice and wish to proceed

[Edit Post] [Post Anyway]
```

---

## üîÑ Feed Integration

### Probability Cloud Algorithm
The reputation system integrates with the existing feed algorithm by:

1. **Reputation Weight**: 10% of feed scoring algorithm
2. **Visibility Multipliers**: Applied to final post scores
   - High reputation (95+): 1.1x multiplier (+10% boost)
   - Normal reputation (50-94): 1.0x multiplier (no change)
   - Low reputation (30-49): 0.9x multiplier (-10% suppression)
   - Very low reputation (<30): 0.8x multiplier (-20% suppression)

3. **Cached Reputation**: Posts store author reputation at creation time
4. **Fair Visibility**: Low reputation reduces visibility but never eliminates it

### Feed Algorithm Weights
```javascript
const feedWeights = {
  recency: 0.30,      // Newer content
  similarity: 0.25,   // Content similarity to user interests
  social: 0.25,       // Posts from followed users
  trending: 0.10,     // Popular/engaging content
  reputation: 0.10    // Author reputation
};
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Gaming Measures

### Per-Post Penalties
- Each post can only generate ONE penalty, regardless of reports
- Prevents coordinated attacks from tanking someone's score
- Multiple reports on same post don't stack

### Daily Limits
- **Rewards**: Maximum +2 points per day
- **Penalties**: No limit (bad behavior has immediate consequences)
- **Overflow Queue**: Excess positive actions queue for next day

### Report Validation
- AI validates reports to prevent weaponized reporting
- False reports don't impact target's reputation
- Pattern detection for coordinated attacks

### Rate Limiting
- Max 5 content warnings per hour per user
- Prevents spam posting to trigger system
- Graceful degradation when limits hit

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Appeals System

### Three-Tier Appeal Process

1. **AI Review** (Automatic)
   - Uses Azure OpenAI to review original penalty and appeal reason
   - High confidence decisions (>70%) processed automatically
   - Low confidence flagged for admin review

2. **Admin Review** (Human)
   - Complex cases escalated to admin panel
   - 48-hour response time commitment
   - Can overturn or uphold AI decisions

3. **Transparency Logging**
   - All appeals and decisions logged
   - Appeal reasoning required
   - Overturned decisions restore points + small bonus

### Appeal Example
```
Original Penalty: -8 points for "harassment"
User Appeal: "I was criticizing the policy, not the person. 
The comment 'supporters of this policy are misguided' is 
political criticism, not personal harassment."

AI Review: "Appeal has merit. Original content criticizes 
policy position rather than individuals. Overturning penalty."

Result: +8 points restored + 20% bonus = +10 points total
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### System Statistics
- **Tier Distribution**: Percentage of users in each reputation tier
