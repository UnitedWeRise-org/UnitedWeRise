# ADR-002: Admin Subdomain Routing for Session Isolation

**Status**: Accepted (Implemented October 17, 2025)
**Deciders**: Development Team
**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Related**: CHANGELOG.md (2025-10-17), MASTER_DOCUMENTATION.md (Admin Dashboard Isolation)

---

## Context and Problem Statement

The UnitedWeRise platform previously served both the main public site and the admin dashboard from the same domain (`www.unitedwerise.org`), with the admin dashboard accessible at the path `/admin-dashboard.html`. This architecture created a critical **login conflict** where logging into one interface would overwrite the session of the other.

### Problem Details

**User Journey Example:**
1. Admin logs into admin dashboard at `www.unitedwerise.org/admin-dashboard.html`
2. Admin session established (JWT token stored in localStorage, cookies set)
3. Admin opens main site in new tab to test public-facing features
4. Admin logs into main site as a regular user
5. **Problem**: Main site login overwrites admin session
6. Admin dashboard now shows logged out or shows regular user permissions
7. Admin forced to log out and log back in as admin

**Root Cause:**
- Both interfaces share the same browser origin (`www.unitedwerise.org`)
- Browser same-origin policy treats same domain as single origin
- Single origin = single storage namespace for cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage
- Both interfaces competing for same storage keys (e.g., `authToken`, `user`, `sessionId`)

**Impact:**
- Admin workflow disruption (constant re-authentication)
- Security risk (admin accidentally using regular user account)
- Poor user experience (confusion, lost work)
- Operational inefficiency (admins cannot test both interfaces simultaneously)

### Constraints and Requirements

**Platform Constraints:**
- Azure Static Web Apps serves identical content for all custom domains
- No hostname-based routing support at Azure level
- No server-side redirect capability (static content only)
- DNS CNAME records all point to same Azure Static Web App

**Business Requirements:**
- Must maintain existing admin dashboard URL for backward compatibility
- Must not disrupt current admin workflows during migration
- Must be reversible if issues discovered after deployment
- Must work across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Session isolation between main site and admin dashboard
- No visible performance degradation (<10ms redirect time)
- No flash of wrong content before redirect
- Preserve query parameters (email verification tokens, deep links)
- Support both production and staging environments

**Operational Requirements:**
- No new deployment infrastructure or DevOps complexity
- No changes to backend API or authentication system
- No database schema changes
- Minimal ongoing maintenance burden

---

## Decision Drivers

1. **User Experience**: Eliminate login conflicts that disrupt admin workflows
2. **Security**: Prevent accidental cross-contamination of admin and user sessions
3. **Operational Simplicity**: Avoid adding deployment infrastructure complexity
4. **Industry Standards**: Follow established patterns used by major platforms
5. **Reversibility**: Ability to roll back quickly if issues arise
6. **Performance**: No user-visible delay or degradation
7. **Maintainability**: Clear, simple architecture that future developers can understand

---

## Considered Options

### Option A: Separate Azure Static Web Apps (Ideal Architecture)

**Description**: Create dedicated Azure Static Web Apps for admin dashboard

**Architecture:**
```
Production:
- www.unitedwerise.org    → unitedwerise-frontend (Static Web App #1)
- admin.unitedwerise.org  → unitedwerise-admin (Static Web App #2)

Staging:
- dev.unitedwerise.org       → unitedwerise-frontend-staging (Static Web App #3)
- dev-admin.unitedwerise.org → unitedwerise-admin-staging (Static Web App #4)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ True content isolation (admin code completely separate from main site)
- ✅ Independent deployment of admin features (no risk to main site)
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (admin vs public code)
- ✅ Industry standard architecture (AWS Console, Google Workspace use this)
- ✅ Better security (admin code not exposed to public)
- ✅ Easier to apply admin-specific security policies

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires creating 2 new Azure Static Web Apps (staging + production)
- ❌ Separate GitHub Actions workflows for admin deployments
- ❌ Need dedicated admin build process (separate from main site)
- ❌ Higher operational complexity (4 Static Web Apps instead of 2)
- ❌ More complex rollback procedures (two deployments to coordinate)
- ❌ Additional Azure costs (marginal, but non-zero)
- ❌ Team concerns about managing multiple deployment pipelines

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 8-12 hours
**Estimated Ongoing Maintenance:** +30% operational burden

---

### Option B: Client-Side JavaScript Redirect (Selected)

**Description**: Use JavaScript to detect admin subdomain and redirect to admin dashboard

**Architecture:**
```
DNS Level:
- admin.unitedwerise.org → CNAME to same Azure Static Web App as www

Azure Static Web Apps:
- Serves identical content for all custom domains (limitation)

Browser Level:
- Loads admin-redirect.js FIRST (before any other scripts)
- Detects hostname === 'admin.unitedwerise.org'
- Redirects to /admin-dashboard.html
- Browser same-origin policy provides session isolation
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create ES6 module: `frontend/src/utils/admin-redirect.js`
   - Checks if `window.location.hostname` is admin subdomain
   - Only redirects from root path (`/` or `/index.html`)
   - Uses `window.location.replace()` to prevent back button loop
   - Preserves query parameters and URL hash

2. Update `frontend/index.html`
   - Add `<script type="module" src="src/utils/admin-redirect.js"></script>`
   - MUST be first module loaded (before main.js)
   - Prevents flash of wrong content

3. Update `frontend/admin-dashboard.html`
   - Add reverse redirect script
   - If accessed from www subdomain, redirect to admin subdomain
   - Ensures admin dashboard only accessible via admin subdomain

4. Update `frontend/src/utils/environment.js`
   - Add admin subdomains to environment detection
   - `dev-admin.unitedwerise.org` → development
   - `admin.unitedwerise.org` → production

**Pros:**
- ✅ Solves login conflict (session isolation achieved)
- ✅ No new deployment infrastructure needed
- ✅ Fast implementation (3-4 hours vs 8-12 hours)
- ✅ Low operational complexity (existing workflows unchanged)
- ✅ Easy rollback (single git revert)
- ✅ No backend changes required
- ✅ Works with existing Azure Static Web Apps
- ✅ Performance <10ms (tested in browser)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not "true" content isolation (same code served for all domains)
- ❌ Relies on client-side JavaScript (fails if JS disabled, but acceptable risk)
- ❌ Slight complexity in redirect logic (but well-documented)
- ❌ Admin code still exposed in main site bundle (security not concern for open-source project)

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 3-4 hours
**Estimated Ongoing Maintenance:** +5% operational burden (minimal)

---

### Option C: Azure Front Door with URL Rewrite Rules

**Description**: Use Azure Front Door to route based on hostname

**Architecture:**
```
Azure Front Door:
- Route: admin.unitedwerise.org → rewrite to /admin-dashboard.html
- Route: www.unitedwerise.org → serve normally

Backend: Same Azure Static Web App
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Server-side routing (no client-side JavaScript needed)
- ✅ Works even if JavaScript disabled
- ✅ Clean URL rewriting at CDN level

**Cons:**
- ❌ Additional Azure service (Azure Front Door)
- ❌ Additional monthly cost (~$35/month minimum)
- ❌ Complex configuration (Front Door rules difficult to debug)
- ❌ Overkill for simple redirect requirement
- ❌ Front Door learning curve for team
- ❌ Another service to monitor and maintain

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 6-8 hours
**Estimated Ongoing Maintenance:** +20% operational burden
**Additional Cost:** ~$420/year

---

### Option D: Azure Application Gateway

**Description**: Use Azure Application Gateway for hostname-based routing

**Pros:**
- ✅ Server-side routing
- ✅ Works without JavaScript

**Cons:**
- ❌ Expensive (~$125/month minimum)
- ❌ Overkill for static site routing
- ❌ Designed for load balancing, not simple redirects
- ❌ Complex setup and maintenance

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 8-10 hours
**Estimated Ongoing Maintenance:** +25% operational burden
**Additional Cost:** ~$1,500/year

**Verdict:** Rejected due to cost and complexity

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Option B - Client-Side JavaScript Redirect**

### Rationale

After thorough analysis and team discussion, Option B was selected based on:

1. **Solves the Problem**: Achieves session isolation via browser same-origin policy
2. **Operational Simplicity**: No new deployment infrastructure or Azure services
3. **Cost**: No additional Azure costs (vs $420-1,500/year for alternatives)
4. **Implementation Time**: 3-4 hours vs 6-12 hours for alternatives
5. **Reversibility**: Single git revert to rollback if issues arise
6. **Team Consensus**: Team expressed concern about managing 4 Static Web Apps (Option A)
7. **Industry Validation**: Client-side redirects used successfully by many production sites

### Future Migration Path

Option A (Separate Static Web Apps) documented as **future architecture goal** in MASTER_DOCUMENTATION.md with the following criteria for migration:

**Triggers for Migration:**
1. Admin dashboard becomes large enough to justify separate deployment
2. Team comfortable managing multiple deployment pipelines
3. Need for independent admin feature releases (decoupled from main site)
4. Security requirements mandate admin code isolation

**Migration Readiness:**
- DNS records already in place (no additional DNS changes needed)
- Frontend code already separated (admin dashboard is separate HTML file)
- Environment detection already recognizes admin subdomains
- Can migrate incrementally (one environment at a time)

**Decision Date for Re-evaluation:** Q2 2026 (6 months after implementation)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Admins can use main site and admin dashboard simultaneously without login conflicts
- ✅ No confusion about which account is currently active
- ✅ Faster admin workflows (no constant re-authentication)

**Security:**
- ✅ Reduced risk of admin accidentally using regular user account
- ✅ Clear separation between admin and public sessions
- ✅ Browser same-origin policy provides automatic isolation

**Development:**
- ✅ No changes to authentication system or backend APIs
- ✅ No database schema changes required
- ✅ Minimal ongoing maintenance burden

**Operations:**
- ✅ No new deployment infrastructure to manage
- ✅ Existing GitHub Actions workflows unchanged
- ✅ Single git revert for rollback if needed

**Cost:**
- ✅ Zero additional Azure costs
- ✅ Saved ~$420-1,500/year vs server-side routing alternatives

### Negative Consequences

**Technical Debt:**
- ⚠️ Client-side redirect adds minor complexity to codebase
- ⚠️ Admin code still bundled with main site code (not isolated at build level)
- ⚠️ Reliance on JavaScript (fails if JS disabled, but acceptable for admin dashboard)

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Not "true" content isolation (same Azure Static Web App serves all content)
- ⚠️ Cannot independently deploy admin features without deploying main site
- ⚠️ Admin code visible in main site source (not a concern for open-source project)

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Technical Debt:**
- Comprehensive documentation created (troubleshooting guide, ADR, CHANGELOG entries)
- Automated testing checklist documented for future deployments
- Future migration path to Option A documented in MASTER_DOCUMENTATION.md

**For Limitations:**
- Acceptable trade-offs given current project size and team capacity
- Re-evaluate in Q2 2026 for potential migration to separate Static Web Apps

## Compliance and Standards

### Industry Standards

**Subdomain Isolation Pattern Used By:**
- AWS Console: console.aws.amazon.com vs aws.amazon.com
- Google Workspace: admin.google.com vs google.com
- Microsoft 365: admin.microsoft.com vs microsoft.com
- Salesforce: login.salesforce.com vs salesforce.com
- GitHub: github.com vs gist.github.com

**Browser Security Standards:**
- Same-origin policy (W3C standard since 2010)
- ES6 modules (ECMAScript 2015 standard)
- Modern browser support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)

### Security Considerations

**Session Isolation:**
- Browser same-origin policy provides automatic cookie/localStorage isolation
- Different subdomains = different origins = separate storage namespaces
- No risk of session token leakage between origins

**JavaScript Security:**
- Redirect script uses `window.location.replace()` (prevents history pollution)
- No eval() or innerHTML (XSS-safe)
- Error handling prevents script failures from breaking page load

**HTTPS Enforcement:**
- Azure Static Web Apps enforces HTTPS for all custom domains
- SSL certificates auto-renewed by Azure
- No risk of credentials transmitted over unencrypted HTTP

## Appendix A: Browser Same-Origin Policy

### What is Same-Origin Policy?

The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.

**Origin Definition:**
- Protocol + Domain + Port
- Examples:
  - `https://www.unitedwerise.org` (origin 1)
  - `https://admin.unitedwerise.org` (origin 2 - different subdomain)
  - `http://www.unitedwerise.org` (origin 3 - different protocol)

**Storage Isolation:**
- Each origin has separate storage namespaces:
  - Cookies (domain-specific)
  - localStorage (origin-specific)
  - sessionStorage (origin-specific)
  - IndexedDB (origin-specific)

**Why This Solves the Problem:**
- `www.unitedwerise.org` = Origin A
- `admin.unitedwerise.org` = Origin B
- Browser treats them as separate origins
- Sessions stored in Origin A cannot be accessed from Origin B
- No code changes needed - browser automatically enforces isolation

## Appendix B: Alternative Architectures Considered and Rejected

### Iframe-based Isolation

**Description**: Load admin dashboard in iframe with different subdomain

**Rejected Because:**
- Complex postMessage communication between parent and iframe
- Poor user experience (iframe scrolling, resizing issues)
- Security concerns (clickjacking, iframe breakout)
- Difficult to maintain and debug

### Cookie Domain Scoping

**Description**: Use domain=www.unitedwerise.org vs domain=admin.unitedwerise.org

**Rejected Because:**
- Requires backend changes to cookie-setting logic
- localStorage still shared (only solves cookie isolation)
- More complex than subdomain routing
- Doesn't address root cause (same origin)

### LocalStorage Key Prefixing

**Description**: Prefix all keys with 'admin_' or 'user_' in shared storage

**Rejected Because:**
- Requires extensive code changes across entire frontend
- Error-prone (easy to miss keys, typos)
- Still risk of key collision or accidental overwrites
- Doesn't actually provide true isolation
