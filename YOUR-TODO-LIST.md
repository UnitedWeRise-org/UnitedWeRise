## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong:

### "I can't find the resource group in Azure Portal"
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Azure account
- Try direct link: https://portal.azure.com/#@c3418fd6-1a5a-48f6-9600-4ca53d952dc1/resource/subscriptions/f71adbbe-4225-40e8-bb8a-9ae87086477f/resourceGroups/unitedwerise-rg/overview

### "I can't add GitHub secrets"
- You need admin permissions on the GitHub repository
- Check you're logged into GitHub as the repo owner

### "GitHub Actions still failing"
- Double-check the 3 secret names are EXACTLY:
  - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` (not Azure_Client_ID or anything else)
  - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
  - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- Make sure you completed Task 1 (role assignment)

### "Staging backend still shows old commit"
- Wait the full 5 minutes for deployment
- Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
- Run: `curl -s https://dev-api.unitedwerise.org/health` to see full status
