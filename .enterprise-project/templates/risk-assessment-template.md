### Impact Scoring
```
Impact Scale:
CRITICAL (4): Project failure, major system outage, >40% timeline delay, >50% budget overrun
HIGH (3):     Significant delays, major rework required, 20-40% timeline delay, 25-50% budget overrun
MEDIUM (2):   Moderate impact, some rework needed, 10-20% timeline delay, 10-25% budget overrun
LOW (1):      Minor impact, minimal delays, <10% timeline delay, <10% budget overrun
```

**Overall Impact Score:** [1-4] - [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

### Probability Assessment
| Factor | Likelihood | Reasoning |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Historical Precedent** | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [REASONING_BASED_ON_PAST_EXPERIENCE] |

LOW (1):    <30% chance of occurrence, few indicators present
```

**Overall Probability Score:** [1-3] - [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

### Risk Level Matrix
```
Risk Level = Impact × Probability

           │ LOW(1)  │ MEDIUM(2) │ HIGH(3)  │

LOW(1)     │ LOW     │ LOW       │ LOW      │
```

**Risk Level:** [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Risk Score:** [IMPACT_SCORE] × [PROBABILITY_SCORE] = [TOTAL_SCORE]
